> **What would a 4D being actually see?** This interactive engine uses ray tracing to show how observers at different dimensional levels perceive the same reality.

## 🎯 What This Does

Demonstrates **observer-dependent reality** across dimensions through a three-step process:

**Step 1: Ray Tracing** → Light paths from observer through 4D hyperspace  
**Step 2: 3D Perception** → Observer's volumetric construction  
**Step 3: 1D Collapse** → Ultimate dimensional reduction to a single axis  

**The insight:** What you perceive depends on what dimensions you can move through.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔦 **Real-time 4D ray tracing** from arbitrary observer positions
- 👁️ **Perception warping** based on distance (inverse square law)
- 🌈 **W-dimension visualization** - Full spectrum color shifts as you move through the 4th dimension
- 📏 **Dimensional cascade** - See information loss: 4D → 3D → 1D
- 🎮 **Interactive controls** - Navigate through hyperspace in real-time
- ✨ **Particle trails** - Motion visualization through dimensional space
- 📸 **High-res capture** - Export your perspective as portfolio-ready images

## 🎮 How to Use

**Quick Controls:**
1. **Move W slider** (4th dimension) → Watch the entire color spectrum shift!
2. Adjust **X, Y, Z** → Navigate through 3D space
3. Change **FOV** → Adjust field of view
4. Toggle **Trails** → See motion paths
5. Click **CAPTURE** → Save high-resolution image with all three views

**Pro tip:** Set W to extreme values (-5 or +5) and watch the hypercube transform dramatically!
