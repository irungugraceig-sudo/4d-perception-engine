# 🌌 4D Perception Engine

### Ray-Traced Visualization of Four-Dimensional Observer Perspectives

> **What would a 4D being actually see?** This interactive engine uses ray tracing to show how observers at different dimensional levels perceive the same reality.

---

## 🎯 What This Does

Demonstrates **observer-dependent reality** across dimensions through a three-step process:

1. **Ray Tracing** - Light paths from observer through 4D hyperspace
2. **3D Perception** - Observer's volumetric construction with depth
3. **1D Collapse** - Ultimate dimensional reduction to a single axis

**The insight:** What you can perceive depends on what dimensions you can move through.

## ✨ Features

- 🔦 **Real-time 4D ray tracing** from arbitrary observer positions
- 👁️ **Perception warping** based on distance and 4D position
- 🌈 **W-dimension effects** - Colors shift through full spectrum as you m
